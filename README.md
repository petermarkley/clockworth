# Clockworth
DIY Robotic Chiming Wall Clock Made on Raspberry Pi

_**Uses Git-LFS.** [Do not](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1648#issuecomment-260395890) download as ZIP; this will result in [pointer files](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/spec.md) instead of real ones._

Clockworth mixes the charm of an antique with the ease of electric power and NTP sync over Wifi. Chimes the [Westminster Quarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Quarters), and optionally sunrise and sunset using [Sunwait](https://github.com/klada/sunwait). Built with Raspbian Linux on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

## Musical Compositions

* Westminster Quarters, [Revd Dr. Joseph Jowett, 1793](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Quarters#History) → **[Public Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_music)**

* "Sun's Song," Copyright © 1998 by Nintendo → **used according to [U.S. "fair use"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#U.S._fair_use_factors):**
	* **Purpose and Character of Use:** The melody has been re-recorded from scratch using a completely unrelated musical instrument, and included as a small feature of an otherwise completely unrelated kind of work, and is therefore highly transformative.
	* **Amount and Substantiality of Copyrighted Portion:** Only thirteen notes of one marginal melody were used from an epic, action-adventure video game.
	* **Effect Upon the Work's Value:** The market of the use is entirely separate from the market of the copyrighted work. Far from harming it, the use is a celebration of the work which is likely, if anything, to reinforce its market.

	* **Purpose and Character of Use:** The melody has been recorded from scratch using a typically non-performative musical instrument, and included as a small feature of an otherwise completely unrelated kind of work, and is therefore highly transformative.
	* **Amount and Substantiality of Copyrighted Portion:** Only thirteen notes of the musical composition were used.
	* **Effect Upon the Work's Value:** The market of the use is entirely separate from the market of the copyrighted work. Far from harming it, the use is a celebration of the work which is likely, if anything, to reinforce its market.
