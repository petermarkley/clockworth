https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#U.S._fair_use_factors
	1) Purpose and Character of Use
		The melody has been re-recorded from scratch using a
		completely unrelated musical instrument, and included
		as a small feature of an otherwise completely
		unrelated kind of work, and is therefore highly
		transformative.
	3) Amount and Sustainability of Copyrighted Portion
		Only thirteen notes of one marginal melody were used
		from an epic, action-adventure video game.
	4) Effect Upon the Work's Value
		The market of the use is entirely separate from the
		market of the copyrighted work. Far from harming it,
		the use is a celebration of the work which is likely,
		if anything, to reinforce its market.
